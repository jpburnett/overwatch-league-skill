## What the Skill Does?
The Overwatch League Skill gives information about the overwatch league game schedule and scores. 

Here is a list of current features:

1. Ask Alexa when any team plays next.
   - Ex. "Alexa open Overwatch League and ask "When does the {**team name**} play next? Team names being Outlaws, Dynasty, etc.
   
   Alexa will respond with the date and time of the requested teams game. Provided you granted access to your location the times should be time zone adjusted to your time zone.
