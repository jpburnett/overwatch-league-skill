## What the Skill Does?
The Overwatch League Skill gives information about the overwatch league game schedule and scores. 

Here is a list of current features:

1. Ask Alexa when any team plays next.
   - Ex. "Alexa open Overwatch League and ask "When does the {**team name**} play next? Team names being Outlaws, Dynasty, etc.
   
   Alexa will respond with the date and time of the requested teams game. Provided you granted access to your location the times should be time zone adjusted to your time zone.


## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Blizzard and the Overwatch League Devs for providing/allowing the use of the API. It has been a fun side project working on this! 

We hope to add more features as time goes on.


# Setting Up The Test Environment
1. Clone the Repo and open it in a text editor of your choice
2. Begin making some glorius code
3. To test the code you will need to navigate to the executable area, to do so run the command ```which node``` this finds the first instance of a specified executable in the PATH environment variable. From there you can start to toy around in the playground you make.

(This is mostly for my sake since I forget how to do it every bloody time)
